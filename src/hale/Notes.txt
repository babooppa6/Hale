BUGS
- Vertical anchor is not updated when the text is being inserted.

NEXT TASK

CRITICAL
- Make the editor working first, so you can use it as soon as possible.
- Do the fancy stuff later. (Lua, Console, etc.)

NEXT BUG
- Removing lines above the viewport.

TRICKS
- Pass -platform windows:fontengine=freetype to application to render through freetype.

BUGS
- Tokens shift to -1 line when lines are inserted.

TODO

- Use deque where possible.
- Avoid using indexes in the containers.
    - Try to calculate the index from the pointer/iterator.
    - How does the deque calculate the distance?
    - DocumentBlock::Blocks
- Implement a document block object to store information for the lines.
    - Includes indentation?
    - Includes parser information.
        - Stacks (front & back)
        - Scopes
    - Should also contain end indexes?
    - Include decorators (errors, breakpoints, etc.)
        - Wouldn't it be better to store these in a map?

- Animations in editor
    - Change in height (add or remove).
    - Change in viewport.
    - Each tick when the height is changed, re-layout the lines below.
    - Each tick only use first/last block in the visible array to see what needs to be added/removed.

IDEAS
- Ctrl+` to switch to code-command mode in which the current operation is converted to code. Typically a search.

- Ctrl+Tab to switch through history.
- Ctrl+~ to switch with filter.

- All commands are specified using javascript functions.
- Each command has a name and a scope.
