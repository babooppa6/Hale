# Notes from the Stream

This is my personal document I keep to collect ideas, links and music that happen during the streams on http://twitch.tv/martincohen for anyone wanting to check back on it.

# Stack

* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Remove text and delete/backspace commands.
# Fix parser not re-parsing the lines (probably only the first line).
* ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+ Undo
	+ QDataStream replacement for Undo
+ Saving file via a shortcut (Ctrl+S)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Get rid of current implementation of memory_push, use it only for inserting more items (with optionally growing when the limit is reached).
	+ For pushing more memory (without incrementing the count), implement memory_push_capacity(memory, capacity)
+ Selections
+ Command line
+ Multiple cursors
+ Splits (at least to see two views on one document)
+ Command scopes & configuration


# Later

- Parsing
	- String interning / symbols for parser.
	- Make sure that the tokens are never overlapped. Although,... do we really need that?
		+ Might even want to add a rule, that every new token should only be placed at position >= last_token.begin
- Keep 0.5 multiplies of the base font's line height to keep the rhythm of the rendered text.
- Selections
	+ Custom DirectWrite Renderer
		* Background rectangles
		* Get rid of IDWriteTextLayout and replace the formatting with our own.
			- TextFormat should be a simple struct without dependency on the RenderTarget.
				+ Window should create the platform representation on demand.
		* Get rid of public API dependency on ID2D1Brush, only use it when drawing.

- Layout updates
	+ Document > DocumentLayout
		* We can let the DocumentLayout to compare the version number it has stored for the block with the block in the document. That way the document layout will be completely lazy, and won't have to do synchronized bookkeeping with what Document blocks.
		* When document version is near the overflow limit for the version, it'll call the DocumentLayout 
		itself to reset the version number.
		* Version numbers can be 
	+ Relayout

- Path normalization and utilities.
- Runtime encoding type info.
	- Encoding preambles
	- Encoding detection by preamble
	- Possibility to optimize/replace conversion function for Hale > X and X < Hale. For most common X (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, Windows-1250, Windows-1252)
- Document Descriptors
	+ Will need serialization format, use Qt's JSON for now.
	+ Will need directory listing.
	+ Can we skip this and leave it for later?
- UndoStream
	+ We can keep prototype version for a while.

# Animating Caret

<d7samurai> i would just store the pixels that are covered by the caret
<d7samurai> and render that and then the caret on top (with alpha)
<martincohen> hmm... okay, I'll get back to you on that (as I'm not sure I know how to do it with Direct2D, yet)
<martincohen> but I'll investigate
<d7samurai> ah.. direct2d.. i forget
<d7samurai> well, i have been though many similar considerations in my system
<d7samurai> (only i need to draw many many things that happen to be behind some semi-transparent stuff that is changing)
<d7samurai> you have something called ScissorRects that will allow you to mask areas in the rendertarget so they are not overwritten
<d7samurai> and you can make a rendertarget also be a shader resource (i.e. a texture the gpu can read from)
<d7samurai> so it's possible to do a draw call that will "copy" the area where the caret is
<d7samurai> to some other texture
